* We propose a low-illumination facial image enhancement system with Generative Adversarial Network for Low-light Age Estimation (LAE-GAN), and CNN models for age estimation. These systems are designed to overcome the performance degradation caused by low-illumination environment. Three open databases named as MORPH [1], FG-Net [2], and AFAD [3] are used for experiments. LAE-GAN and age estimation models are opened to other researchers for fair judgement.

## Implementation
* Python >= 3.5
* Tensorflow >= 2.2.0
* Window 10 or Unbuntu 10.4
